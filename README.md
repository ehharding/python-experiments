# Python Experiments and Explorations

Welcome to my collection of Python projects, coding challenges, and explorations. This repository serves as a personal
"digital garden" where I experiment with different algorithms, libraries, and programming concepts.

## About This Repository

This is a monorepo, meaning it contains multiple distinct projects, each in its own subdirectory. The goal is to keep
related experimental work organized in a single location.
